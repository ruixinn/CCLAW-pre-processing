EXPECTED: 10 In its application, the Applicant primarily seeks: (a) leave of court under s 210(1) to call a meeting of creditors to consider the proposed Scheme, and (b) for further financing provided by the Subscriber to be considered “rescue financing” and be given super priority under s 211E in the event of the Applicant’s winding up.###In its written and oral submissions, the Applicant relies primarily on the matters deposed in the various affidavits filed on its behalf.

EXPECTED: 11 In relation to the amounts owed to TAMI by the Applicant, the Applicant maintains that TAMI is owed S$2,355,394 from the Applicant.15 TAMI is a contingent creditor of the Applicant as the Applicant had given TAMI a guarantee in respect of advances disbursed by TAMI to various members of the Group (see [5] above).###Even though TAMI is also concurrently a debtor to the Applicant because TAMI had provided a counter indemnity dated 1 January 2015,16 no equitable set-off is possible between the two debts since the transactions are not related or connected with each other: Pacific Rim Investments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong and another [1995] 2 SLR(R) 643.17

EXPECTED: 14 In respect of the relevance of Conchubar, the Applicant notes that the Court of Appeal did not find that there was a lack of clarity or uncertainty in the schemes proposed in that case, but only that there was no “meaningful compromise” because of intervening events.###In the present case, there is similarly no uncertainty in the proposed Scheme.20###As for the discounting of related creditors’ votes, following Conchubar, what mattered is whether there exists any relationship between the creditors and the scheme company.###There is no such relationship alleged in the present case. Phillip Asia should be in the same class as the contingent creditors (ie, the Put Option Holders and TAMI) because their positions are analogous.21###In any event, the issue of proper classification of creditors should only be considered at a later stage of the s 210 process.22

EXPECTED: 16 Phillip Asia argues against both aspects of the Applicant’s application: (a) for leave to convene a creditors’ meeting to consider the proposed Scheme, and (b) for subsequent loans disbursed by the Subscriber to be given super priority status in the event of the Applicant’s winding up.

EXPECTED: 45 With regard to the classification of creditors and whether Phillip Asia should be placed in the same class as TAMI and the Put Option Holders, the inquiry at the calling of meeting stage is only “a preliminary determination” (see TT International at [61]):###… Indeed, without a preliminary determination of the correct classification of creditors, how can it be known whether a scheme is likely to attract sufficient support and subsequently pass muster?###Further, if it were certain from the outset that certain opposing creditors would be classified separately so that the scheme would never pass, then it would be a futile exercise###to even conduct scheme creditors’ meetings…###Based on a preliminary determination, I am not convinced, on an application of the dissimilarity principle, that Phillip Asia should be in a separate class from TAMI and the Put Option Holders because all of their interests are similarly unsecured: see TT International at [140]–[143].

EXPECTED: 50 The concept of super priority status for rescue financing is alien to English Companies law-based regimes.###As for the US, the super priority provisions introduced in Singapore are not wholly similar to the provisions of Chapter 11.###Nonetheless, it was clear that the Singapore amendments were at least inspired by those US provisions (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 March 2017) vol 94 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Finance)):###… The next feature of Chapter 11 that is being adapted are rescue financing provisions. Rescue financing consists of new loans which provides working capital during the restructuring.###Without rescue financing, a viable company may be unable to restructure, but lenders may be reluctant to provide additional financing to troubled companies.###To facilitate rescue financing, the Court will be empowered to order that rescue financing be given super-priority.###That means priority over all other debts or to be secured by a security interest that has priority over pre-existing security interests, provided the pre-existing interests are adequately protected.###This is consistent with the approach in Chapter 11.

EXPECTED: 52 The statutory requirements for the grant of super priority are specified in s 211E.###That provision permits the court to make any of several orders, essentially giving priority to rescue financing in the event of the company’s winding up, as follows: (a) as if it were part of the costs and expenses of winding up (sub- section (1)(a)); (b) priority over all preferential debts and unsecured debts, if the company could not have obtained the rescue financing unless this priority is given (sub-section 1(b)); (c) security on property that is not otherwise subject to any security, or subordinate security on property subject of existing security, if without such security the rescue financing could not be obtained (sub- section 1(c)); and (d) to have the same or higher priority security than an existing security if without such security the rescue financing could not be obtained and there is adequate protection for the interests of the holder of the existing security (sub-section 1(d)).

EXPECTED: 54 On the first issue as to whether the proposed financing from the Subscriber constitutes “rescue financing”, Phillip Asia argues that the Subscriber’s offer of finance is subject to pre-conditions and is also vague,47 47 Creditor’s Skeletal Submissions at paras 4–6. presumably implying that these disqualify it from being considered “rescue financing”.###I find that there is little merit in this argument.###There is nothing in the language of s 211E(9) that prohibits a rescue financier from stipulating conditions in the grant of its rescue finance.###This is also sound given that the decision as to whether to extend financing and on what terms is ultimately a matter for commercial consideration.###Further, from a perusal of the Subscriber’s letter to the Applicant dated 6 July 2017,48 I do not find the Subscriber’s proposal to be vague.###The Subscriber unequivocally stated that it “shall forbear from terminating the Subscription Agreement and continue in supporting [the Applicant] via continued subscription to the Convertible Notes on the following terms and conditions”.49###In my view, this is clear enough an expression of intent to extend rescue financing to the Applicant.

EXPECTED: 56 Without intending to lay down anything that may constrict the flexibility that is often required in restructurings, I am compelled to point out that some thought should be given by applicants to the appropriate type or level of super priority sought, and they should also be prepared to provide the rationale for what they seek.###Indeed, as Phillip Asia points out, the Applicant should have specified from the outset which limb of s 211E(1) is being invoked.###Without such specification, proceedings will be hampered.###Any opposing creditor would need to know which specific limb is being relied upon and prepare its arguments accordingly.###Be that as it may, in the present proceedings, the Applicant eventually clarified in oral arguments that it is relying on sub-sections (a) or (b) of s 211E(1), that is priority as part of the expenses of winding up, or priority over all of the preferential and unsecured debts.

EXPECTED: 65 Turning now to the other limb, s 211E(1)(b) provides that the court may order in the winding up of the company that the debt arising from any rescue financing obtained will have priority over all preferential debts specified in the 55 Creditor’s Bundle of Authorities at Tab C.###CA and all other unsecured debts, provided that the company would not have been able to secure the rescue financing unless such priority is given.###Phillip Asia argues that this power is similar to § 364(c) of Chapter 11, which reads as follows:56 If the trustee is unable to obtain unsecured credit allowable under section 503(b)(1) of this title as an administrative expense, the court, after notice and a hearing, may authorize the obtaining of credit or the incurring of debt– (1) with priority over any or all administrative expenses of the kind specified in section 503(b) or 507(b) of this title; (2) secured by a lien on property of the estate that is not otherwise subject to a lien; or (3) secured by a junior lien on property of the estate that is subject to a lien.###Phillip Asia cites In re Western Pacific,57 a US case interpreting § 364(c) of Chapter 11, in which it was specified that (1) the proposed financing has to be in the exercise of sound and reasonable business judgment; (2) no alternative financing is available on any other basis; (3) such financing is in the best interest of the creditors; and (4) no better offers, bids, or timely proposals are before the court.58

EXPECTED: 66 There have been several other US cases interpreting the same provision.###In addition to the factors highlighted above, the following additional factors have been considered as relevant in US case law (see eg, In re Mid-State Raceway, Inc and others 323 BR 40 (Bankr, ND New York, 2005) (“In re Mid- State Raceway”) at 60): (a) the proposed credit transaction is necessary to preserve the assets of the estate, and is necessary, essential, and appropriate for the continued operation of the debtors’ businesses; (b) the terms of the financing agreement are fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the circumstances of the debtor and the proposed lender; and (c) the financing agreement was negotiated in good faith and at arm’s length between the debtor, on the one hand, and the agents and the proposed lender, on the other hand.

EXPECTED: 68 Turning to the present case, the Applicant fails to satisfy the material condition stated in s 211E(1)(b).###Super priority can only be granted under s 211E(1)(b) where the applicant “would not have been able to obtain the rescue financing from any person unless the debt arising from the rescue financing is given the priority mentioned in this paragraph” [emphasis added in italics and bold italics].###This is a condition for the grant of super priority.###The local position is thus similar to the US where super priority can be granted under § 364(c) only where the debtor is “unable to obtain unsecured credit per [§ 364(b) of Chapter 11]”: see [65] above and In re The Crouse Group, Inc 71 BR 544 (Bankr, ED Pennsylvania, 1987) (“The Crouse Group”) at 549.59###As to what it means by being “unable to obtain”, the US case law shows that the debtor must demonstrate that he “has reasonably attempted, but failed” to seek credit from other available sources [emphasis added] (In re Ames at 37).60###Due to the difference in statutory language, what the reasonable efforts must be in respect of, should logically differ in Singapore but the broader idea remains that the applicant must expend reasonable efforts to source for less disruptive sources of financing, ie, financing without the type of super priority sought.

EXPECTED: 70 The undertaking of reasonable efforts does not however mean that the debtor must show that he had sought credit from “every possible source”: In re Ames at p 40.61###The idea remains that of reasonableness and this is a matter for the court’s assessment.###The threshold of what constitutes reasonable efforts to demonstrate unavailability of funds can be discerned from several US cases.###For instance, In re Ames, the court found that the burden was met where the debtors had approached four lending institutions with the capacity to loan the “large sums” needed by the debtors (at 40).###In In re Mid-State Raceway, the court found that the debtor’s efforts, including conducting negotiations and discussions with various financial entities, constituted reasonable efforts (at 59).###In stark contrast, in The Crouse Group, the court concluded that the burden was not met where the debtor had approached only one lending institution and never attempted to obtain financing from its existing creditors (at 550).62###Ultimately, the court must make a determination as to how “extensive the debtor’s efforts to obtain credit must be” on a case-by-case basis (In re Reading Tube Industries 72 BR 329 (Bankr, ED Pennsylvania, 1978 at 332).###The inquiry is a fact- sensitive one and no bright-line rule can be drawn.

EXPECTED: 71 On the facts, Phillip Asia argues that the Applicant has adduced insufficient evidence as to the exploration of other opportunities for financing.###There was only a purported offer to Phillip Asia itself, which took place 11 days before the hearing of this application.###There is accordingly no evidence that the Applicant had made any “serious attempts” at sourcing for other financing.63 The Applicant contends that what it did was reasonable in the circumstances given the financial difficulties faced by the company.64

EXPECTED: 73 The only attempt that was adduced was its offer of super priority to Phillip Asia on 3 August 2017.67###In my view, this attempt is irrelevant for two reasons.###First, this was not an effort by the Applicant to source for financing on a normal basis, ie, without the type of super priority sought under s 211E(1)(b), since the Applicant extended the same terms of super priority to Phillip Asia as it did to the Subscriber.###Even if it was an effort to obtain financing from Phillip Asia without any offer of super priority, there is a graver difficulty with its timing.###Whilst the Applicant applied for super priority on 7 July 2017, the offer to Phillip Asia was only made on 3 August 2017.###Before the application for super priority was taken out, the Applicant must have already attempted to search for other sources of financing and then come to the conclusion that it is left with little choice but to obtain rescue financing from the Subscriber on a super priority basis.###It will make a mockery of the application process if the Applicant is allowed to adduce evidence of subsequent attempts to source for alternative financing after an application for super priority has already been made.

EXPECTED: 77 In principle, in order to come within the scope of “rescue financing” under s 211E(9), it is not necessary for the proposed financing to be entirely new; it can be additional financing from an existing creditor or it can even be premised on a prior obligation.###What matters is whether that obligation persists: if the existing creditor is already bound to inject funds, then the provision of funds pursuant to that pre-existing obligation is not financing that should be accorded the protection and priority under s 211E.###If, however, the injection of funds is at the option of the creditor, and its exercise of that option can be made contingent on its obtaining super priority status for these injected funds, then there is to my mind no reason why these funds could not, in appropriate cases, be conferred super priority under s 211E.###This is consistent with the rationale expressed in Parliament that the laws on super priority are aimed at encouraging creditors to provide “additional financing” for troubled companies (see Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (10 March 2017) vol 94 (Ms Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State for Finance)): Rescue financing consists of new loans which provides working capital during the restructuring.###Without rescue financing, a viable company may be unable to restructure, but lenders may be reluctant to provide additional financing to troubled companies.
