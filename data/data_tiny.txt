1 This case concerns an application by a company for, among other things, the court’s leave to convene a meeting of creditors to consider a proposed scheme of arrangement under s 210(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”) (“s 210(1)”), as well as super priority to be granted in respect of rescue financing sought to be obtained by the company under the recently introduced s 211E of the CA (“s 211E”).
2 The company, Attilan Group Limited (“the Applicant”), is a locally incorporated company that is listed on the main board of the Singapore Exchange.1 It is the holding company of a group of companies active in the media and education business (“the Group”).2
3 At the end of 2016, the Applicant issued two circulars to its shareholders. The first circular sought approval for a proposed diversification of the Group business to include early childhood education.3 The second circular concerned the proposed issue of 1.0% unsecured equity-linked redeemable structured convertible notes due in 2018 for a total of up to S$50,000,000 to an intended subscriber, Advance Opportunities Fund 1 (“the Subscriber”), under a subscription agreement (“the Subscription Agreement”).4 The Subscription Agreement provides that the Subscriber subscribes for convertible loan notes which may be converted into the Applicant’s shares and that the subscription is over several tranches and sub-tranches. On 5 January 2017, the Applicant’s shareholders approved the resolutions under both these circulars.5
4 Phillip Asia Pacific Opportunity Fund Ltd (“Phillip Asia”), a locally incorporated company, is a creditor of the Applicant. Phillip Asia is a creditor because the Applicant, through its subsidiary, provided a guarantee dated 24 April 2014 to Phillip Asia for the benefit of Turf Group Holdings Limited, a company which was previously part of the Group.6 On the basis of this guarantee, Phillip Asia issued a letter of demand against the Applicant on 16 January 2017, and thereafter instituted a suit in the High Court, vide, Suit No 223 of 2017 (“the Suit”), against the Applicant on 13 March 2017.7
5 Since the issuance of the letter of demand by Phillip Asia, the Applicant has incurred various liabilities. These include contingent debts arising from put options given by the Applicant to investors (“the Put Option Holders”), who had in turn invested in 2013 to 2014 into a fund (“the Fund”) that was managed by the Applicant’s subsidiary, Tap Private Equity Pte Ltd. According to the Applicant, the put options were effectively guarantees by the Applicant to the Put Option Holders that they would be repaid their principal amounts invested.8 Further, a guarantee was given by the Applicant to Tremendous Asia Management Inc (“TAMI”) in respect of several advances disbursed by TAMI to various members of the Group, in consideration of TAMI deferring legal proceedings on these outstanding advances.9 The nature and extent of these liabilities are disputed by Phillip Asia.
